<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Sofia</h1>
<h3 align="left">A full stack software developer based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.</h3>
<p>I have a background in music, where I first discovered my love for experimenting with new technologies, innovative sound design and the process of creating and mastering the wide range of software available in that space. I realised that I wanted to expand that passion for creation and innovation into the world of tech. I fell in love with the process of tailoring interfaces and code to fully suit the human needs and intentions behind technology, building things that empower and excite people. I am all about making creative and functional solutions to solve unique problems.

<h3 align="left">Projects</h3>

<h3 align="left">Glighfe</h3>
<p>Our final week long project for Dev Academy! A mobile-first full stack social media app for communicating with pictures and symbols instead of words. I was the product owner for this project, responsible for managing the direction of the project and the group as a whole. On the technichal side of the project I worked on the image upload functionality, commenting and revising most of the apps design, aesthetics and user interface. Some improvents left for sure (if I get the chance sometime my first bug fix will be figuring out whatever is going wrong with the follow button) but this project was a huge effort for a team of junior developers and I am very proud of the technical acheivements of the final product.  </p>

<h3 align="left">Swamp Soul Online</h3>
<p>I'm currently working on a full stack application for Swamp Soul, a local diy music collective that is looking for a way to archive their history, display the collectives work and create their own individualised way to connect with the Te Whanganui-a-Tara music scene. Modern streaming and social media sites have numerous ethical and technical issues that make our artists want to use them less. They are considered necessary evils for artists who want any chance of accessing wider audiences and communicating easily with their current audiences. As a collective Swamp Soul has been discussing for a while the potential of creating our their own piece of digital land, something that avoids the profit motivated designs of the various platforms artists currently use and allows the people who want to step away from those platforms a chance to still to connect directly and stay in touch with the local music and art community around them. The app uses Auth0 verification, Cloudflare image upload and storage, an Sqlite database and and number of other technologies. In it's current state it will act as a calendar for upcoming shows, where users can personalise their upcoming show pages to individualise them for the acts playing. Upcoming features will include a historical archive of previous shows, pages for individual artists and much more. </p>

<h3 align="left">Type 1 Meal Calculator</h3>
<p>My mother is a type 1 diabetic, a condition that requires a large amount of self maintenance and vigilance. Many diabetics like my mother who aren't using automatic insulin pumps and monitoring apps simply calculate thier own insulin requirements around meals based on a few factors: their own sensitivity to insulin, how high or low their blood sugar is already and the carbohydrates in the meals they consume. These calculations can get rather complex and can be affected by a number of things like time of day, their maximum insulin intake during a day and what methods they have to administer their insulin (what size of insulin unit does their pen allow?). I thought this was an excellent chance for technology to help simplify things, helping assist in these calculations based on the individual factors (insulin sensitivity etc) that users had already worked out with professional doctors and dieticians. Obviously it is just a code excersise and NEVER intended to be used to give medical advice, I just wanted to explore the potential of a tool like this for bettering the day to day lives of people with the condition. </p>
